# Step-by-Step Development Approach for KnowledgeCompass

1. **Project Setup**
   - Initialize a Git repository and push to GitHub (public).
   - Set up the folder structure (`src/`, `data/`, `assets/`, etc.).
   - Configure build tools (e.g., Vite, Webpack) and TailwindCSS.

2. **Core Data Models**
   - Define JSON schemas for mind map nodes, story segments, and user progress.
   - Create sample data files in `data/` (e.g., `curriculum.json`, `stories/`, `audio-manifest.json`).

   - Display illustrations, infographics, and interactive charts.

7. **Assessment & Progress**
   - Track node completion, time spent, and achievements.
   - Add contextual quizzes and exercises with analytics.

8. **API Integration**
   - Integrate Gemini API for dynamic content, explanations, and quizzes.

9. **Accessibility & UX**
   - Ensure keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, and color contrast.
   - Add adjustable playback speed and text size controls.

10. **Testing & QA**
    - Write unit and integration tests for components and data.
    - Test performance, cross-browser compatibility, and mobile responsiveness.

11. **Deployment**
    - Set up PWA features and deploy to GitHub Pages or another public host.
    - Monitor performance and collect user feedback.

12. **Maintenance & Iteration**
    - Regularly update content, fix bugs, and improve based on feedback.
